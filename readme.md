# UI PhD Study Plan Template

This is a study plan template for the School of Engineering and Natural Sciences at the University of Iceland.

## Instructions

- Largely self-explanatory
- Keep track of the bibliography and the names
- Needs the Calibri font
- Also needs the logo, _do not_ delete `logo`

## Compilation

Locally this needs `xelatex`.

```{bash}
latexmk -pdfxe -shell-escape -8bit -pvc studyPlanSENS.tex
```

## Overleaf

This repo is also submitted to Overleaf for use as a template.

## License

The logo is reserved for use by the University of Iceland. The rest of the content is junk. The template itself is MIT licensed.
